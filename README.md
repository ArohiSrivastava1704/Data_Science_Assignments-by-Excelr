# Data_Science_Assignments-by-Excelr

By Arohi Srivastava

Overview
This repository contains the data science assignment completed as part of the Data Science with AI course offered by ExcelR Institute. The project demonstrates key concepts and techniques learned during the course, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset(s) used for the project.
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with the implementation of the assignment.
reports/: Documentation and visualizations summarizing the results.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to [insert the objective here, e.g., "build a predictive model to estimate house prices" or "analyze and visualize trends in sales data"].

Methodology
The assignment involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
EDA: Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Model Development: Building machine learning models using techniques such as [e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.].
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Results
Key insights: [Summarize main findings here]
Model performance: [Include metrics like accuracy, RMSE, etc.]
Tools and Technologies
